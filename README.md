# üö¶ Traffic Light Controller in Verilog

This repository contains the Verilog code for a simple **Traffic Light Controller** for an intersection between a **Highway** and a **Farm Road**.

---

## üìå Project Overview
The project models a traffic light system where the **highway traffic has priority**.  
- By default, the **Highway light stays Green** while the **Farm road light stays Red**.  
- The system only changes state when a **car is detected** on the farm road via sensor **C**.  
- The controller is implemented as a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Default State:** Highway = Green, Farm = Red.  
- **Sensor-based Trigger:** Light cycle starts when sensor `C = 1` (car detected).  
- **State Sequence:**
  1. **Highway Green / Farm Red** ‚Üí Initial & default state.  
  2. **Highway Yellow / Farm Red** ‚Üí Highway turns yellow for **3 seconds**.  
  3. **Highway Red / Farm Green** ‚Üí Farm road turns green for **10 seconds**.  
  4. **Highway Red / Farm Yellow** ‚Üí Farm road turns yellow for **3 seconds**.  
  5. Returns to **Highway Green / Farm Red**.  
- **Active-low Reset:** System can be reset to the initial state.

## üìÇ File Descriptions
- `traffic_light.v` ‚Üí Main Verilog module for the **Traffic Light Controller FSM**.  
- `tb_traffic.v` ‚Üí Testbench file to **simulate and verify** functionality.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use
1. Install a Verilog simulator (e.g., **ModelSim**, **Vivado**, or **Icarus Verilog**).  
2. Compile both files:  
   ```bash
   iverilog -o traffic_sim traffic_light.v tb_traffic.v
   vvp traffic_sim
3. Run the simulation with tb_traffic as the top module.

4. Open the generated waveform (.vcd file) in GTKWave (or a supported viewer) to observe behavior.

## üìä Simulation Waveform

The waveform demonstrates the state transitions when the farm road sensor C is triggered.

- Default (Highway Green / Farm Red)

- Highway Yellow ‚Üí Farm Green ‚Üí Farm Yellow

- Back to Default
